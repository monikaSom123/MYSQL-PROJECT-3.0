8. Can you define a trigger that is invoked automatically before a new row is inserted into a table?


    MySQL BEFORE INSERT triggers are automatically fired before an insert event occurs on the table.
   The following illustrates the basic syntax of creating a MySQL BEFORE INSERT trigger:

    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    BEFORE INSERT
    ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
   trigger_body;

    If you have multiple statements in the trigger_body, you have to use the BEGIN END block and change the default delimiter:
    DELIMITER $$

   CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    BEFORE INSERT
    ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
     BEGIN
    -- statements
    END$$    

    DELIMITER ;

9  What are the different types of triggers?
   A trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, update, or delete that occurs in the associated table.
   MySQL supports triggers that are invoked in response to the

    INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE event.
   AFTER INSERT activated after data is inserted into the table. 
 
   AFTER UPDATE: activated after data in the table is modified. 
 
   AFTER DELETE: activated after data is deleted/removed from the table. 
 
   BEFORE INSERT: activated before data is inserted into the table. 
 
   BEFORE UPDATE: activated before data in the table is modified. 
 
    BEFORE DELETE: activated before data is deleted/removed from the table.

10  How is Metadata expressed and structured?
    Metadata is machine understandable information about web resources or other things

    A given metadata statement can be expressed in any of a variety of encodings. On the Web, these presently include HTML, XML, and RDF-XML,
    but other encodings or bindings may emerge over time
 
    Structural metadata is used for creation and maintenance of the information warehouse. It fully describes information warehouse structure and content.
    The basic building block of structural metadata is a model that describes its data entities, their characteristics, and
     how they are related to one another.

 12  What is the difference between amazon EC2 and RDS?
																								
    -- AMAZON RDS-- 

  Amazon Relational Database  Service is a distributed relational database service provided by Amazon Web Services. Amazon RDS brings ease of setup,
   operation, and scaling to relational databases in AWS Cloud.
   There are several database engines supported by RDS, including MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
   e type of database instance you select for each engine depends on its CPU, memory, storage, and networking requirements.

  --AMAZON EC2--
 
 The Elastic Compute Cloud operates within Amazon Web Services and provides scalable computing power. With Amazon EC2, we can develop and 
 deploy applications much more quickly since we don't have to invest in any hardware.
 
  We can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as we need, in order to configure security and networking and manage the storage.
